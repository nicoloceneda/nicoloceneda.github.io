Welcome to the Black Swan, Nicolo Ceneda's webpage. I am PhD candidate in Finance at Imperial College London, where I am a member of the <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/imperialassetpricing/home">Asset Pricing Research Group</a>. I conduct research in theoretical asset pricing and applied machine learning with a focus on fixed income securities and financial derivatives. 
</p>

<p>
I hold a BSc in Finance from Bocconi University, a MA in Finance from the University of St Gallen, and I have been a visiting student at UCLA, Cornell University, and Stanford University. Prior to my PhD, I interned in the investment bank of Deutsche Bank in Zurich and London. More recently, I interned again at Deutsche Bank in London as a quantitative researcher. I worked with the hybrid rates and algorithmic rates trading desks to develop machine learning models to forecast the volatility of Treasury futures.
