Welcome to the Black Swan, Nicolo Ceneda's webpage.
</p>

<p>
I am PhD candidate in Finance  at Imperial College London. I conduct research in theoretical asset pricing and applied machine learning with a focus on fixed income securities and financial derivatives. I am a member of the <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/imperialassetpricing/home">Asset Pricing Research Group</a>. My work is supervised by Harjoat Bhamra and Franklin Allen and is funded by the President’s PhD Scholarship.

I hold a BSc in Finance from Bocconi University (IT), a MA in Finance from the University of St Gallen (CH), and I have been a visiting student at the UCLA (US) and Cornell University (US). Prior to my PhD, I interned in the investment bank of Deutsche Bank in Zurich, where I worked in credits and rates sales, and in London, where I worked in equity derivatives structuring and FX options trading. More recently, I interned again at Deutsche Bank in London as a quantitative researcher. I worked jointly between the hybrid rates trading and the algorithmic rates trading desks to develop machine learning models to forecast the volatility of Treasury futures.

My hobbies are poker (Pokerstars), chess (Lichess) and go-kart racing. My favourite food is pizza.
